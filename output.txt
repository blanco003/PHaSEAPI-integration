2. Are there any specific ingredients you'd like to include?
3. Are there any ingredients you'd prefer to avoid?

  If the constraint "TAGS_DIETARY_PREFERENCES" does not appear in the "removedConstraints" field, emphasize that the suggested recipe is well aligned with the user's future dietary preferences [], reinforcing that the recommendation supports their personal goals and sustainable food journey.
  Do not mention missing constraints if the "removedConstraints" field is empty. 
  Take into account the following allergies ['fish'] and dietary restrictions [] to avoid trivial or irrelevant comparisons for the user.
  If the recipe the recipe to be suggested contains ingredients that the user is allergic to, also provide only the name of the recipe beside to explain why he cant eat it,
  without mentioning the sustainable/healthiness and instructions of it, but instead ask him if he wants to remove or ingredients to the preferences to receive a new recipe suggestion.
  Use the field explanation of the recipe, to support the explanation of why this recipe was recommended.
  
  Write an empty row for better readability before the environmental part.

  Write a sentence to introduce the environmental impact of the recipe, using a representative emoji to start it. 
  Use information about the carbon footprint and water footprint of the ingredients, stored in the score fields CF and WF of the recipe's sustainability field, to support your explanation, but keep it simple and understandable, using a bullet point for each concept.
  Refer to numbers of CFP and WFP, but also provide an idea of whether those values are good or bad for the environment.
  
  The sustainability score is a categorical score across 5 levels indicating sustainability from A (best) to E (worst).
  The sustainability score of the recipe is stored in the score field of the recipe's sustainability field.
  Do not provide it explicitly but use a Likert scale to describe it printing from 0 to 5 stars (use ascii stars, using black stars as point and white stars as filler).
  
  Write a sentence to introduce the healthiness of the recipe, using a representative emoji to start it. 
  Use information about the nutritional_values, ingredients and quantities of the recipe to support your explanation, but keep it simple and understandable, using a bullet point for each concept.

answer: 
 TOKEN 3.30

Looking at the environmental impact of these recipes:

Base Recipe (Chilli Mushrooms): ★★★★★
• 🌱 Carbon Footprint: 1.77 kg CO2
• 💧 Water Footprint: 2542 liters

Improved Recipe (Mushroom and Chilli Pasta): ★★★★★
• 🌱 Carbon Footprint: 2.46 kg CO2
• 💧 Water Footprint: 2466 liters

To transform the base recipe into the improved version:
• 🍝 Add pasta as the main carbohydrate source
• 🍄 Keep the mushrooms and chili as key ingredients
• 🌿 Consider adding herbs and garlic for extra flavor

While the improved recipe has a slightly higher carbon footprint, it maintains an excellent sustainability rating and actually reduces water usage. Both recipes show impressive environmental credentials with their plant-based ingredients.

🌟 Try this delicious pasta version for a more satisfying meal that's still kind to our planet! Your choice will be recorded in your profile to help track your sustainable eating habits.

Would you like to know more about the specific ingredients or cooking instructions for the improved recipe?

• 💧 Water Footprint: 4,159.6 liters - This represents a moderate water consumption, primarily from chicken production. However, the recipe's efficient use of ingredients and reasonable portions helps maintain sustainability.

Overall sustainability rating: ★★★★☆

The recipe achieves a good sustainability level thanks to:
• 🌱 Simple, whole ingredients
• 🥘 Balanced portion sizes
• 🔄 Efficient use of resources with minimal waste potential

This recipe represents a reasonable choice for environmentally conscious cooking while still enjoying a flavorful meal.

 TOKEN 6.40

🌍 Let me explain the environmental impact of Cacio e Pepe, which shows an excellent environmental performance:

• 🏭 Carbon Footprint: 2.08 kg CO2eq - This is a relatively low carbon footprint, mainly from cheese production, but the simplicity of ingredients keeps the overall impact minimal.

• 💧 Water Footprint: 1,176 liters - This is a very good water footprint, significantly lower than many pasta dishes with meat or more complex ingredients.

Overall sustainability rating: ★★★★★

The recipe achieves excellent sustainability thanks to:
• 🌱 Minimal ingredients (just pasta, cheese, and pepper)
• 🥘 Plant-based main component (pasta)
• 🧀 Moderate use of dairy

Compared to Chicken in Cumin Sauce, Cacio e Pepe has a lower environmental impact, using about 72% less water and producing slightly less carbon emissions, making it a more sustainable choice.

🍖 Let's examine the nutritional profile of these Meatballs, which shows some concerning aspects regarding its healthiness:

• 🔥 High caloric content (333.4 calories per serving), with more than half coming from fat (175 calories)
• 🥩 High protein content (25.1g) is a positive aspect
• ❤️ Concerning levels of saturated fat (7.5g) and cholesterol (132.1mg)
• 🧂 Moderate sodium content (496.9mg)
• 🌾 Low fiber content (0.9g) and minimal sugar (1.8g)

Based on the Nutri-Score system, which evaluates the overall nutritional quality considering beneficial (proteins, fiber) and unfavorable (saturated fats, sodium, calories) components, this recipe rates:
★☆☆☆☆

This rating suggests room for improvement. Consider reducing portion sizes or modifying ingredients to include more vegetables and whole grains for better nutritional balance.

answer: 
 TOKEN 6.40

🥗 Let me share insights about the healthiness of Spicy Garlic Beef Stir Fry:

• 🍖 Protein content is relatively low at 10.7g per serving, which might not meet daily protein needs

• 🧂 High sodium content (775.4mg) due to soy sauce and beef bouillon, approaching half the daily recommended limit

• 🍚 High in carbohydrates (89.2g) mainly from white rice, which could impact blood sugar levels

• 🥬 Good fiber content (6.2g) from vegetables like snow peas, bell pepper, and asparagus

• 🍳 Moderate fat content (7.8g) with low saturated fats (1.1g), which is positive

Overall nutritional quality: ★☆☆☆☆
This rating reflects concerns about high sodium and refined carbohydrates, despite the positive inclusion of vegetables and moderate fat content. Consider using brown rice and reducing sodium-rich seasonings to improve the nutritional profile.
